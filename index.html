     <p>Today I have learnt about tags. There are a lot of tags in HTML, 
        but these few are used more often and so they were mentioned today.<br />
        The Paragraph Tag, the Anchor Tag, the Break Tag, and the Horizontal Rule. 
        I also learnt how to target my links. All of these have been applied on this page.</p>
