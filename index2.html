    <!-- Paragraph Tag -->
    <p>So far I have learnt about structure tags of HTML. There are a lot of tags in HTML, 
        but these few are used more often and so they are mentioned as follows:<br>
        The Head Tag<br> The Meta Tag<br> The Title Tag<br> The Body Tag<br> The Paragraph Tag<br> The Anchor Tag<br>
        The Break Tag<br> and The Thematic Break Element also known as the Horizontal Rule.<br>I also learnt that 
        the Normal Tags require both an opening and a closing tag, while the Self-closing Tags do not.<br>
        I also learnt how to use the comments in my code, how to create a hyperlink using The Anchor Tag, and how 
        to target my links using the (_blank) target value.<br>All of these have been applied on this page.
